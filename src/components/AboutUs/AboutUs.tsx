        It all started when we created our own bars of soap, that unforgettable
        feeling when smelling all the aromas and found how skin-caring would
        have such a blend of oil. It was a SOAPLUSH that we’d like to share with
        you!!! Our sincere products are rich in plush oils, skin-pampering
        additives and moisturizing glycerine wrapped to you with love and
        passion. We’ve just got to handle you an aromatic caring lush to
        flourish your day and those you love!! Although we know that we have a
        long way before us, to reach our goals we’d like to, we instantly also
        know that what we’ve done up till now is a great real glory for our
        humble experiences and knowledge. Yet, we certainly know that no matter
        what, we will never give upon the main concept of our soaps that’s being
        purely natural and organic. Our credibility indeed is our capital we
        brag with...

        We, as “SOAPLUSH” team, try our best to maintain the best quality of the
        best of our ingredients. We use oils that we are so sure of their
        authenticity, the blend we use is 100% natural, the aromas, the
        colorants and even the smallest detail within. The process we use in the
        soap making is the slow one to assure the high qualifications and
        assertion of its wellness. Well, we usually undergo a trial process, so
        we try the efficiency of our soaps before we handle them out. Told you,
        credibility is our brand! Cuddle your sensations with all that love we
        put in our products. Hope you enjoy using them as much as we enjoy
        making them for you.
